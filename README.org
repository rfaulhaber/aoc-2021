#+TITLE: Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for Advent of Code 2021.

My goals for this Advent of Code are:
- Learn more about language-oriented development with Racket. Thus, Racket-based
  solutions may be more contrived than others
- Learn a handful of new languages

Languages used will be:
- C
- OCaml
- Racket
- Forth
- Julia

Optional languages that will be used only after a problem has been solved in one
of the above languages:
- Haskell
- Common Lisp
- Elixir
