#+TITLE: Day2 Language

Day2 is a DSL meant for solving the [[https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2][Advent of Code 2021 day 2 challenge]].

The language has three functions: ~forward~, ~down~, and ~up~. Each takes a
number, mutating the program state.

Additionally, there are four other functions: ~print~, which prints the current
state, ~eval~, which lets you load in commands from another file, ~part1~, which
prints the solution to part 1 of the challenge, and ~part2~, which prints the
solution to part 2 of the challenge.

Day2 has no comments.

A sample program could be as such:

#+begin_src
eval ./sample.day2

forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2

print
part1
part2
#+end_src
