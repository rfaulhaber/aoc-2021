#+TITLE: Day2 Language

Day2 is a Racket ~#lang~ reader language meant for solving the [[https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2][Advent of Code
2021 day 2 challenge]].

The language has three functions: ~forward~, ~down~, and ~up~. Each takes a
number, mutating the program state.

Additionally, there are four other functions: ~print~, which prints the current
state, and ~solve~, which, when given either 1 or 2, will print the solution for
part 1 or 2.

Day2 has no comments and very little error checking. It is very easy to break.

A sample program could be as such:

#+begin_src
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2

solve 1
solve 2
#+end_src
